## Visibility

You can use these [REST API Endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#update-a-repository) or follow these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#update-a-repository).

## LFS

You can follow these [steps](https://github.github.com/enterprise-migrations/#/./4.3.0-post-migration-global-caveats?id=lfs).

## Permissions

You can manage repository permissions by:
- using teams
  - create a team
    - [UI](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team)
    - [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-team)
  - add a member to a team
    - [UI](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/adding-organization-members-to-a-team)
    - [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/teams/members?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-or-update-team-membership-for-a-user)
  - give permission to a team on a repository
    - [UI](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)
    - [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/teams/teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions)
- managing individual permissions
  - give permission to a user on a repository
    - [UI](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-an-individuals-access-to-an-organization-repository)
    - [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/collaborators/collaborators?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-a-repository-collaborator)

We strongly recommend to use teams for managing repository permissions and visibility, facilitating conversaton, and reducing management overhead. Teams used for permission management should be synced with an IdP group (like Okta). This allows existng IdP processes and audit controls to be relied upon for managing access to code.Onboarding, ofboarding, and access changes are all managed by the IdP.  
With teams, you can easily see which teams maintain which projects: a list of all repositories to which a team has been granted explicit permissions (beyond the organizaton’s default) is available on each team’s page in GitHub.

- at the repository level:
  - actions secrets by following these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)

  - dependabot secrets by following these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot#adding-a-repository-secret-for-dependabot)
- at the organization level:
  - actions secrets by following these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-organization)
  - codespaces secrets by following these [steps]( https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces#adding-secrets-for-an-organization)

## Environments

You can create/udpate an environment by following these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) or using this [REST API Endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment).

## Branch protection rules

You can create/udpate a branch protection rule by following these [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#about-branch-protection-rules) or using this [REST API Endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/branches/branch-protection?apiVersion=2022-11-28#update-branch-protection).

## Discussions

You cannot really migrate the discussion but you can recreate important ones by using the [GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/using-the-graphql-api-for-discussions) for example.

## Webhooks

You can follow these [steps](https://github.github.com/enterprise-migrations/#/./4.3.0-post-migration-global-caveats?id=webhooks).

## GitHub Apps

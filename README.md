## How to use it?

You have to create a personnal access token with this scope:
- `codespace:secrets`
- `read:discussion`
- `admin:org`
- `read:packages`
- `read:project`
- `repo`

Then, you have to store the value in a GitHub Actions Secret called `PAT`. 

Finally, you can manually trigger the workflow called `Migration assessment` and give the name of the org that you want to assess.
